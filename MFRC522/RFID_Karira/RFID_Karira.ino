//** I Kushagra Karira has relesed this modified version of MFRC522 tutorial on Github (github.com/kushagrakarira/iota) as the source file for team iota, accessible after August 2020**//
/*
  This sketch uses the MFRC522 Library to use ARDUINO RFID MODULE KIT 13.56 MHZ WITH TAGS SPI W AND R BY COOQROBOT.
  The library file MFRC522.h has a wealth of useful info. Please read it.
  The functions are documented in MFRC522.cpp.

  Based on code Dr.Leong   ( WWW.B2CQSHOP.COM )
  Created by Miguel Balboa (circuitito.com), Jan, 2012.
  Rewritten by SÃ¸ren Thing Andersen (access.thing.dk), fall of 2013
  Updated by Kushagra Karira ( kushagrakarira.github.io )

  This library has been released into the public domain.
