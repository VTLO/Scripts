# Scripts
I found a github rerpo as scripts made by a hacker friend that was a joke but inspiration behind this repo. these are real working scripts that will do simple tasks for you.

## Description for each file :
 Theming.sh - Installs FlatRemix ( complete theme ) and gives option to install StarLabs cursor
 
 Aptt.sh - I'm using debian testing and updating each day is a pain. This will update, upgrade, autoremove(purge) and clean each time.
