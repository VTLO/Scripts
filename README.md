# Scripts
I found a GitHub repo as scripts made by a hacker friend that was a joke but inspiration behind this repo. these are real working scripts that will do simple tasks for you.

## Description for each file :
 Theming.sh - Installs Flat-remix ( Icons, Gnome and GTK ) and installs StarLabs cursor
 
 /Android Debloat - My previously recognized project to debloat OEM roms, Windows and Linux supported !!
 -> Github found some vulnerabilities in the latest windows ADB package, had to remove it.
 -> Extract ADB in Windows folder to use the script, the folder should be named ADB and it should contain ADB.exe, continue on your own risk

 /CatSay - Someone gave me a job to make cowsay script, I made CatSay

### Thank you everyone <3, This repo is also a part of the Arctic Code Vault by Github
